Floobits adds support for real-time collaborative editing to text editors and IDEs.  In addition to Atom, Floobits also supports [Sublime Text](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-sublime), [Emacs](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-emacs), [Vim](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-vim), and [IntelliJ](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-intellij).

This plugin also allows collaborators to video chat using WebRTC and to share terminals via the [term3 plugin](https://atom.io/packages/term3) without leaving atom.

For a demo of this plugin in action, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwChJKd4og) of [ggreer](https://github.com/ggreer) and [btipling](https://github.com/btipling) pairing on [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher).

[Documentation](https://floobits.com/help/plugins/atom) is on the Floobits website.
