# [Floobits](https://floobits.com/) plugin for Atom

Real-time collaborative editing. Think Etherpad, but with native editors. This is the plugin for Atom. We also have plugins for [Sublime Text](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-sublime), [Emacs](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-emacs), [Vim](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-vim), and [IntelliJ](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-intellij).

### Development status: pre-alpha. Totally unstable and unusable. Don't install this yet.

# Configuration

All configuration settings are stored in `~/.floorc.json`. If you donâ€™t have a `~/.floorc.json` file, the plugin will create one.

# Help

If you have trouble setting up or using this plugin, please [contact us](https://floobits.com/help#support).
