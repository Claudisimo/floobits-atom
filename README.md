Real-time collaborative editing. Think Etherpad, but with native editors. This is the plugin for Atom. We also have plugins for [Sublime Text](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-sublime), [Emacs](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-emacs), [Vim](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-vim), and [IntelliJ](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-intellij).

### Development status: Alpha. Under heavy development.

Documentation is lacking, but you could probably get by using the Sublime Text docs.

## Configuration

A Floobits account is required.  If you don't have one, the plugin will guide you through the process.

## Help

If you have trouble setting up or using this plugin, please [contact us](https://floobits.com/help#support).
